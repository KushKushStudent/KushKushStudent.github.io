        <p>The stories in Borges’s Ficciones are very, “Questioning”.  The stories force the reader to think, question meaning, and dig deeper. There are deep messages and existential thoughts nestled between intricately woven tales, and these messages are still important, looking at creation, and more specifically, creation of art and information.  His imagery relates closely to the ideas and ideals that (should)drive the internet , from creating valuable work, to the invention of the hypertext style.  
            The Library of Babel(1998) is described as being  “total” , however this proves valueless, as we see librarians committing suicides and some risking their lives in search of the book to guide them.  The internet, like the library, is a vast collection of information, however it is our duty, both as web developers and merely users of the internet, to populate it with meaningful content. The internet should be a tool, not merely a labyrinth of the useless.   In the story, the library is touted as having all the answers yet no one expects to find anything of value when they are searching, this should not be the case when it comes to the internet.
            The Garden of The Forking Paths(2003) similarly teaches principles that can be applied to the internet. In the story, the characters great grandfather throws himself into solitude for 13 years to write an infinite labyrinth and a novel, but is assassinated and his work was presumed unfinished and senseless. Hidden in this story is a lesson about not only creativity and art, but the infinite possibilities therein. Ts’ui Pen created a labyrinth through the forking paths of the book, by imagining other possibilities and making them all occur instead of only one being chosen, and this is invention of the  hypertext novel.  This modal form of traversal defines the internet, it is how information is passed and located. Each web link starts with “https”, Hypertext transfer protocol, so each link we click, is merely another decision leading us deeper into The Garden of the Forking Paths. 
            Lastly we look, at Bush’s As we may think, written in 1979 yet predicted a large amount of technological advancements that we now have and were nowhere near existing at the time. Almost a love note to the present from the past, the reading present the idea that innovation is vision put into action. We evolve as we innovate but Bush also warns us to be cautious as he concludes, that these new creations can be used for(and bring things) bad as well as good, however we cannot let this stop our advancement into the future while striving towards being good.
