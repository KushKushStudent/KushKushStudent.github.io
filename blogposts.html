        <p>The stories in Borges’s Ficciones are very, “Questioning”.  The stories force the reader to think, question meaning, and dig deeper. There are deep messages and existential thoughts nestled between intricately woven tales, and these messages are still important, looking at creation, and more specifically, creation of art and information.  His imagery relates closely to the ideas and ideals that (should)drive the internet , from creating valuable work, to the invention of the hypertext style.  
            The Library of Babel(1998) is described as being  “total” , however this proves valueless, as we see librarians committing suicides and some risking their lives in search of the book to guide them.  The internet, like the library, is a vast collection of information, however it is our duty, both as web developers and merely users of the internet, to populate it with meaningful content. The internet should be a tool, not merely a labyrinth of the useless.   In the story, the library is touted as having all the answers yet no one expects to find anything of value when they are searching, this should not be the case when it comes to the internet.
            The Garden of The Forking Paths(2003) similarly teaches principles that can be applied to the internet. In the story, the characters great grandfather throws himself into solitude for 13 years to write an infinite labyrinth and a novel, but is assassinated and his work was presumed unfinished and senseless. Hidden in this story is a lesson about not only creativity and art, but the infinite possibilities therein. Ts’ui Pen created a labyrinth through the forking paths of the book, by imagining other possibilities and making them all occur instead of only one being chosen, and this is invention of the  hypertext novel.  This modal form of traversal defines the internet, it is how information is passed and located. Each web link starts with “https”, Hypertext transfer protocol, so each link we click, is merely another decision leading us deeper into The Garden of the Forking Paths. 
            Lastly we look, at Bush’s As we may think, written in 1979 yet predicted a large amount of technological advancements that we now have and were nowhere near existing at the time. Almost a love note to the present from the past, the reading present the idea that innovation is vision put into action. We evolve as we innovate but Bush also warns us to be cautious as he concludes, that these new creations can be used for(and bring things) bad as well as good, however we cannot let this stop our advancement into the future while striving towards being good.

            Vannevar Bush’s As we may think  has largely predicted many of the technological advancements of today, despite being written around 76 years ago. Things however did not go the way Bush envisioned. The idea sitting behind Bush’s paper was that these devices would act not only as a repository of information, but one that personalized itself to the user, including in the presentation of  information to the user, through personalized association. Essentially the device would be tailored, and further tailor itself to the user and their experiences to act as an external tool for understanding things in the world.  Sadly  for Bush, things went more the way of complicated repositories that the user had to adapt to for it to be of any value. While there are ways to tailor certain things to user nowadays, that ultimately amounts to little as the information that is presented remains the same for the most part, and lacking associatory content. The personalization we know ultimately amounts to a façade of what Bush envisioned. 
            This as an important thing to consider, as we think, “maybe we interpreted the inspiration for the internet wrong”. As Harper(2010) tells us about Vannevar, his paper spawned a generation and technological enthusiasts and created fields that are still evolving and adapting today. Having created such an impactful piece, it makes sense that we look towards his vision, and this is where Vannevar comes off as both scientist as well as humanitarian.
            Vannevar seemed to truly believe that the power of the human mind to associate as a way  of understanding, far surpassed our ability to simply attempt to interpret indexed information as a way of understanding .This alongside Bush’s belief that the machine should tailor itself to the user and not the other way round, allows us to see where we’ve fallen short of what can be a far more humanitarian vision than what we currently have in place.  Bush’s vision emphasizes the use of technology as a tool to help humanity understand and advance as a result, maybe this is the direction we should take back before we lose the web to sea of microtransactions, ads and useless information. 
            I am personally in agreement with Bush, there are definitely ways in which we can try to design further with more tailored information towards the person. At the very least we should allow as much customizability towards that end goal to improve the user experience as much as possible. New technology is cool and all, but there is definitely room for more personally adaptive tech  than tech we have to personally adapt to.

        <p>The meaning of hypertext has clearly evolved over the years, adapting to new technologies and fields that it ‘links’ to. Fruin examines the history of “Hypertext”, looking at the branching definitions, where, and how they were formed 
            Fruin brings up a valid point, that while we can simply search for the historically correct defining group for hypertext,  it is the questioning of the field, and the testing of its boundaries thereof, that keep use progressing and prevent stagnation. Rather the point is brought forth that we should be asking ourselves how these 2 different interpretations formed from a single concept, and seeing how we can  incorporate the many into 1, to broaden our understanding of the field as well as progress it.  Using the encompassing knowledge we now have on various definitions, we now look at examining the original meaning, coined by Theodor Holm Nelson. 
            Nelson defines both hypertext and hyperfilm and refers to them as “new media” , and essentially terms Hypermedia as being a branching presentation of human made media, whether textual or pictorial. Following this he gives the first use of the word “link” , as he describes Hypertext as closely to what we know of it in the internet today,  as sets of text connected to each other by links that can be navigated through. He goes on to define a more hypermedia and from this Fruin deduces that hypertext is a type of hypermedia, and hypermedia itself being manmade media, whereas things such as browsers and calculators are tools that progress knowledge, and not falling under hypermedia.
            From the historical definition that Fruin deduces, we can see how the literary community adopted a link based interpretation due to fictional works such as Borges’s Garden of the Forking Paths, all which viewed hypertext as such. The hypertext research community veered from this, creating what Nelson would describe as being tools or “facilities” for advancement of knowledge. Looking at these 2  definitions, we can see how it is important that both fields question their historical definitions, and advance them to better suit the technology of today as well as broadening the meaning of Hypertext.
            It is interesting to look back on the history of hypertext, especially in the context of the WWW. We advance so fast that it is important we look back and understand the historical intent, so we can understand and better envision ways forward.

        <p>McLuhan(1964)  poses some interesting that points technology as a whole, greatly effects the consequences of art on both a personal and social level.
            McLuhan(1964)  stresses the importance of the medium. The medium in which art is portrayed can greatly affect the message it portrays, and how it is interpreted, meaning that there are consequences to our decisions in art when they are being released to the world.  This comes clear when looking at the difference in a tweet vs a news article. Tweets are usually far easier to post, the platform size makes it easily accessible by many users, and the short length make’s it punchy and easy to read, with platform features allowing it to spread like wildfire. Whereas a news article is usually posted in the paper or a publications website, which often is locked behind paywalls, and contain longer articles that people aren’t usually willing to read or share. Looking at these differences it becomes clear that the reaction to the message directly relates to the medium, and intent behind the mediums use. One is far more likely to spark an immediate trend through twitter than the comments of a news website. 
            McLuhan viewed technology as an extension of the self, the acts of them being the responsibility of the user, and not the technology.  Technology provides us with new mediums, which act as a further extension. McLuhan(1964) makes the point that initially , we shape the purpose of the tools, but over time, the tools shape us through the possibilities the provide to our intent. Technology eventually creates its own norms, and we bend to them. 
            Driving home the title of the paper, is the artform of Cubism. Cubism essentially remade normal art into something new by ignoring perspective. It did not attempt to mimic reality, rather it did a fair job in contradicting it, but still portraying message through the involvement and relation of pieces in the art with each other. This new medium of Cubism opened art to the idea that the medium is the message. 
            Ultimately, the medium changes the way in which information is communicated and spread, meaning that the message of the medium relies within the medium itself and not necessarily the content of the medium. It is the artist who is responsible for the content, but even more responsible for the medium in which it is presented as it is here where consequences form as the message and interpretation are varied across mediums.  
            This stresses the importance, for us as designers, to think carefully about the content we distribute as well as how it is distributed. With social media, the internet, and other evolving technologies, information is more widely available than ever, meaning the consequences are far larger and long lasting, so it is our prerogative as artists, to consider our impact , especially when it comes to web related content.

    <div class="content">
        <p>Metadata is an extremely important aspect of digital technology. Metadata essentially is data on data, that allows us to find the latter data.  Using an example of a police casefile, the metadata is the heading and categorization of the case, whereas everything in the casefile with details on the actual case, is the Data.
            Now that you know this, it probably makes the value of metadata far more clear. Without it, we may as well be searching through a library of information with no titles or descriptions. Looking back in time, metadata finds its roots in the word “Provenance”, which refers to the origins and nature of an object. 
            Essentially what metadata is doing, is tracking an object through time, and the contents of it. Metadata consists of various datasets that define it. If we look at something like the W7 Ontological Model of Metadata, we can see how this model tracks the What, When, Where,Who,How,Which,and why , as  metadata. The content of metadata can vary with different models or purposes, but the value is still there, even though some models provide better information. 
            Metadata is also important as it catalogues and draws relations between data with correlating metadata.  When you perform a google search, the search request itself is a string of keywords that are compared with metadata on websites, articles, etc, which then finds you the most applicable options to click. Metadata is not only useful as a means of cataloguing however, some sets of metadata can  act as indicators of trends for example, regardless of the looking at the actual data.   
            Metadata can also have various qualities, meaning some metadata can be more valuable than others due to things such as the datasets the metadata comprises of. This makes some forms of metadata more useful than others. For example, using a standard model  for a metadata dataset means it can easily communicate with the metadata of other objects with the same metadata structure. This results in more accurate, valuable, and quality content due to the interconnectedness provided by the metadata
            Metadata also allows for things of a similar nature to be suggested. Recommendations on platforms are probably the most visible example, as metadata on your clicks and searches are used to suggest topics with similar metadata. This makes our lives convenient, but also means that a large amount of our data is being tracked through this.
            Metadata is extremely important in tracking and cataloguing information, and without it, we would probably be stuck with a senseless pile of info.
