        <h1 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:rgb(0, 207, 0); font-size:50px; text-align: center;">
            You may be wondering how I got here. </h1>
                <h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
                I remember the day I moved here. My life was uprooted in a flash...and I was left blinded(not literally, ya fuckin' stoner). 
                I struggled to cope with my daily life after dad passed. My mind was always like a ball of thread, tangled and mangled, but he always helped me straighten it out. 
                This was the only place we had left to go. We moved to Johannesburg and Aunt Helen took us in.   </h2>
                <h1 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:50px; text-align: center;"> And that's how I first got to smoke.</h1>
            <h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
                Aunt Helen had 2 sons, Jeff and Greg, my cousins. They were cool, but I struggled to keep pace, or interact with them. I was always nervous...anxious. One day, I took a walk around the back of the house. 
                The Jacaranda's had come into bloom and the sunlight pierced their thin petals to tint the ground purple. It was beautiful. And beneath the trees, I found them... smoking grass.
                
            I was confused at first. My cousins were smoking weed in the backyard??? They looked at me without much care, just puffing away. Then Jeff turned to me and said,<p>"Dude you look like you need to chill out. Smoke?"</p>
             And he held the J towards me. Now I had seen a LOT of Life orientation drug videos...But I also loved Snoop Dogg and That 70's show, sooooooo...
            </h2>


       
        <h1 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:rgb(0, 207, 0); font-size:50px; text-align: center;">
        My first High! </h1>
        <h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
            I was fucked up. There ain't nothing else to it. Ya boi was F-f-f-fucked! You ever looked a tree and thought,
            <p>"Oh my god!The world is in 4k UHD! This is like one of those curved Samsung TVS!"</p>
            But it was also, amazing. For the first time, I wasn't bogged down by all the choices I thought I had to make. I could just...Exist.
            
       
        </h2>
        
       
        <h1 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:rgb(0, 207, 0); font-size:50px; text-align: center;">
        So I started smoking
      </h1>
         <h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
        It calmed me down. I could focus, I could socialise. I could breath. It affected my life in every way. I could finally express myself without as much worry, and my thoughts had never felt less tangled. 
        Not to say I was high all the time. The effects helped me push through what I needed to, so even when I was sober, I was doing good. Everything in moderation.

        <h1 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:rgb(0, 207, 0);font-size:50px; text-align: center;">
So why the website? </h1>
<h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
Well it started as a project, I mean why else would there be such fricken academic blogposts. Honestly, if you read that shit high... it's trippy right... read The Garden of The Forking Paths, will blow your mind stoned... or confuse the shit outa you, 1 of the 2.
Back to the point, It started as a project, then it became a means to fight the demonisation of the, now slowly being legalised, Cannabis/Marijuana/Weed/Ganja/Grass/Herb/Kush(Yeah,stoners have a ton of terms for this shit.)<br>
That, and I wanted this to be a dope website where you can find cool stoner shizz!(Check out Pete's Picks!)

        <h2 style="font-family:'Caveat',cursive ;color:green; font-size:30px; text-align: left;">
        I support the legalisation and use of Cannabis. And declare publically, that I smoked weed...and eat edibles...dry-vape sometimes...occasionally hit the bong...Special occasions call for a dab.</h2>
