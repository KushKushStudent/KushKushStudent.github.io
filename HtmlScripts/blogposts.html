        <p>The stories in Borges’s Ficciones are very, “Questioning”.  The stories force the reader to think, question meaning, and dig deeper. There are deep messages and existential thoughts nestled between intricately woven tales, and these messages are still important, looking at creation, and more specifically, creation of art and information.  His imagery relates closely to the ideas and ideals that (should)drive the internet , from creating valuable work, to the invention of the hypertext style.  
            The Library of Babel(1998) is described as being  “total” , however this proves valueless, as we see librarians committing suicides and some risking their lives in search of the book to guide them.  The internet, like the library, is a vast collection of information, however it is our duty, both as web developers and merely users of the internet, to populate it with meaningful content. The internet should be a tool, not merely a labyrinth of the useless.   In the story, the library is touted as having all the answers yet no one expects to find anything of value when they are searching, this should not be the case when it comes to the internet.
            The Garden of The Forking Paths(2003) similarly teaches principles that can be applied to the internet. In the story, the characters great grandfather throws himself into solitude for 13 years to write an infinite labyrinth and a novel, but is assassinated and his work was presumed unfinished and senseless. Hidden in this story is a lesson about not only creativity and art, but the infinite possibilities therein. Ts’ui Pen created a labyrinth through the forking paths of the book, by imagining other possibilities and making them all occur instead of only one being chosen, and this is invention of the  hypertext novel.  This modal form of traversal defines the internet, it is how information is passed and located. Each web link starts with “https”, Hypertext transfer protocol, so each link we click, is merely another decision leading us deeper into The Garden of the Forking Paths. 
            Lastly we look, at Bush’s As we may think, written in 1979 yet predicted a large amount of technological advancements that we now have and were nowhere near existing at the time. Almost a love note to the present from the past, the reading present the idea that innovation is vision put into action. We evolve as we innovate but Bush also warns us to be cautious as he concludes, that these new creations can be used for(and bring things) bad as well as good, however we cannot let this stop our advancement into the future while striving towards being good.

            Vannevar Bush’s As we may think  has largely predicted many of the technological advancements of today, despite being written around 76 years ago. Things however did not go the way Bush envisioned. The idea sitting behind Bush’s paper was that these devices would act not only as a repository of information, but one that personalized itself to the user, including in the presentation of  information to the user, through personalized association. Essentially the device would be tailored, and further tailor itself to the user and their experiences to act as an external tool for understanding things in the world.  Sadly  for Bush, things went more the way of complicated repositories that the user had to adapt to for it to be of any value. While there are ways to tailor certain things to user nowadays, that ultimately amounts to little as the information that is presented remains the same for the most part, and lacking associatory content. The personalization we know ultimately amounts to a façade of what Bush envisioned. 
            This as an important thing to consider, as we think, “maybe we interpreted the inspiration for the internet wrong”. As Harper(2010) tells us about Vannevar, his paper spawned a generation and technological enthusiasts and created fields that are still evolving and adapting today. Having created such an impactful piece, it makes sense that we look towards his vision, and this is where Vannevar comes off as both scientist as well as humanitarian.
            Vannevar seemed to truly believe that the power of the human mind to associate as a way  of understanding, far surpassed our ability to simply attempt to interpret indexed information as a way of understanding .This alongside Bush’s belief that the machine should tailor itself to the user and not the other way round, allows us to see where we’ve fallen short of what can be a far more humanitarian vision than what we currently have in place.  Bush’s vision emphasizes the use of technology as a tool to help humanity understand and advance as a result, maybe this is the direction we should take back before we lose the web to sea of microtransactions, ads and useless information. 
            I am personally in agreement with Bush, there are definitely ways in which we can try to design further with more tailored information towards the person. At the very least we should allow as much customizability towards that end goal to improve the user experience as much as possible. New technology is cool and all, but there is definitely room for more personally adaptive tech  than tech we have to personally adapt to.

    <section class="content">
        <p>The meaning of hypertext has clearly evolved over the years, adapting to new technologies and fields that it ‘links’ to. Fruin examines the history of “Hypertext”, looking at the branching definitions, where, and how they were formed 
            Fruin brings up a valid point, that while we can simply search for the historically correct defining group for hypertext,  it is the questioning of the field, and the testing of its boundaries thereof, that keep use progressing and prevent stagnation. Rather the point is brought forth that we should be asking ourselves how these 2 different interpretations formed from a single concept, and seeing how we can  incorporate the many into 1, to broaden our understanding of the field as well as progress it.  Using the encompassing knowledge we now have on various definitions, we now look at examining the original meaning, coined by Theodor Holm Nelson. 
            Nelson defines both hypertext and hyperfilm and refers to them as “new media” , and essentially terms Hypermedia as being a branching presentation of human made media, whether textual or pictorial. Following this he gives the first use of the word “link” , as he describes Hypertext as closely to what we know of it in the internet today,  as sets of text connected to each other by links that can be navigated through. He goes on to define a more hypermedia and from this Fruin deduces that hypertext is a type of hypermedia, and hypermedia itself being manmade media, whereas things such as browsers and calculators are tools that progress knowledge, and not falling under hypermedia.
            From the historical definition that Fruin deduces, we can see how the literary community adopted a link based interpretation due to fictional works such as Borges’s Garden of the Forking Paths, all which viewed hypertext as such. The hypertext research community veered from this, creating what Nelson would describe as being tools or “facilities” for advancement of knowledge. Looking at these 2  definitions, we can see how it is important that both fields question their historical definitions, and advance them to better suit the technology of today as well as broadening the meaning of Hypertext.
            It is interesting to look back on the history of hypertext, especially in the context of the WWW. We advance so fast that it is important we look back and understand the historical intent, so we can understand and better envision ways forward.

        <p>McLuhan(1964)  poses some interesting that points technology as a whole, greatly effects the consequences of art on both a personal and social level.
            McLuhan(1964)  stresses the importance of the medium. The medium in which art is portrayed can greatly affect the message it portrays, and how it is interpreted, meaning that there are consequences to our decisions in art when they are being released to the world.  This comes clear when looking at the difference in a tweet vs a news article. Tweets are usually far easier to post, the platform size makes it easily accessible by many users, and the short length make’s it punchy and easy to read, with platform features allowing it to spread like wildfire. Whereas a news article is usually posted in the paper or a publications website, which often is locked behind paywalls, and contain longer articles that people aren’t usually willing to read or share. Looking at these differences it becomes clear that the reaction to the message directly relates to the medium, and intent behind the mediums use. One is far more likely to spark an immediate trend through twitter than the comments of a news website. 
            McLuhan viewed technology as an extension of the self, the acts of them being the responsibility of the user, and not the technology.  Technology provides us with new mediums, which act as a further extension. McLuhan(1964) makes the point that initially , we shape the purpose of the tools, but over time, the tools shape us through the possibilities the provide to our intent. Technology eventually creates its own norms, and we bend to them. 
            Driving home the title of the paper, is the artform of Cubism. Cubism essentially remade normal art into something new by ignoring perspective. It did not attempt to mimic reality, rather it did a fair job in contradicting it, but still portraying message through the involvement and relation of pieces in the art with each other. This new medium of Cubism opened art to the idea that the medium is the message. 
            Ultimately, the medium changes the way in which information is communicated and spread, meaning that the message of the medium relies within the medium itself and not necessarily the content of the medium. It is the artist who is responsible for the content, but even more responsible for the medium in which it is presented as it is here where consequences form as the message and interpretation are varied across mediums.  
            This stresses the importance, for us as designers, to think carefully about the content we distribute as well as how it is distributed. With social media, the internet, and other evolving technologies, information is more widely available than ever, meaning the consequences are far larger and long lasting, so it is our prerogative as artists, to consider our impact , especially when it comes to web related content.

    <section class="content">
        <p>Metadata is an extremely important aspect of digital technology. Metadata essentially is data on data, that allows us to find the latter data.  Using an example of a police casefile, the metadata is the heading and categorization of the case, whereas everything in the casefile with details on the actual case, is the Data.
            Now that you know this, it probably makes the value of metadata far more clear. Without it, we may as well be searching through a library of information with no titles or descriptions. Looking back in time, metadata finds its roots in the word “Provenance”, which refers to the origins and nature of an object. 
            Essentially what metadata is doing, is tracking an object through time, and the contents of it. Metadata consists of various datasets that define it. If we look at something like the W7 Ontological Model of Metadata, we can see how this model tracks the What, When, Where,Who,How,Which,and why , as  metadata. The content of metadata can vary with different models or purposes, but the value is still there, even though some models provide better information. 
            Metadata is also important as it catalogues and draws relations between data with correlating metadata.  When you perform a google search, the search request itself is a string of keywords that are compared with metadata on websites, articles, etc, which then finds you the most applicable options to click. Metadata is not only useful as a means of cataloguing however, some sets of metadata can  act as indicators of trends for example, regardless of the looking at the actual data.   
            Metadata can also have various qualities, meaning some metadata can be more valuable than others due to things such as the datasets the metadata comprises of. This makes some forms of metadata more useful than others. For example, using a standard model  for a metadata dataset means it can easily communicate with the metadata of other objects with the same metadata structure. This results in more accurate, valuable, and quality content due to the interconnectedness provided by the metadata
            Metadata also allows for things of a similar nature to be suggested. Recommendations on platforms are probably the most visible example, as metadata on your clicks and searches are used to suggest topics with similar metadata. This makes our lives convenient, but also means that a large amount of our data is being tracked through this.
            Metadata is extremely important in tracking and cataloguing information, and without it, we would probably be stuck with a senseless pile of info.

                Good user interface is an important part of a user experience, often it can be the deciding factor in whether a user likes or dislikes a particular digital piece. Marcus(1998) stresses the importance of good user interface and how metaphors play a part in this. Marcus points out that good user interface can often decide commercial success based on usability, so when it comes to designing user interfaces,  communication is probably the most important aspect to consider. Specifically, we must consider how best to communicate function, as well as how to best present information so it is easy to understand and recollect. 
                  
                  </p> 


                  <p>
                    The goal is to create a user interface that is easily approachable to a novice user, yet gradually trains them into using more complex features with ease. Marcus suggests that the way to do this is through metaphors.  This means drawing on culturally relevant items  to create clear connections with the user, especially through visuals. For instance, a picture of a camera on a website would cause most user to assume there is a gallery of images shown as a result of clicking that. By drawing on these easily recognizable items, we clear easily and clearly communicate function to a user.
                  
                  </p>


                  <p> Marcus also stresses that it is important that we as designers explore more culturally diverse metaphors so that we can create and implement broader and even more accessible metaphors, as well as keep up to date with the times.  Doing this will also allow us to create content for an ever diversifying audience. </p>
               
                  <p>Ultimately , metaphors are not only a tool for improving the user interface, but also a necessity for creating an accessible and commercially viable product. </p>

                      Hassenzahl and Tractinsky(2006) :User experience 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Hassenzahl and Tractinsky(2006) look further into exactly what UX is, as well as defining and exploring it more clearly. They tell of the shift from a tradition UX focused purely on usability, versus the new outlook for UX that envisions designing for user pleasure and enjoyment.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                     
                          3 perspectives are shown, each focusing on a different aspect with its own viability.  Beyond the instrumental, is a multidimensional model that challenge the traditional view of UX in HCI ,which was geared towards more work scenarios and discounted the concept of beauty, focusing solely on usability . This model was designed to fill various needs considered as part of non-instrumental aspect. Hassenzahl(2006) questions whether it is possible to create a product that provides quality based on the context of the situation.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The next perspective is Emotion and affect. This essentially involves the affect that design can have on the user’s emotions. Given that views on computer interactions at the time were primarily negative, this approach would focus on creating a positive emotional response  through UX. Where the HCI traditionally focused on preventing dissatisfaction, this approach actively focuses on creating a satisfying UX that still satisfies usability.  New approaches appeared, such as viewing affect as a design goal.  Hassenzahl(2006) ultimately asks through this perspective if it is possible for designers to construct emotions,  or if we should focus on creating contexts for emotion to appear?

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The final perspective is the experiential. This focuses on the time and space of it all, involving the state of the system as well as the user.  The core goal here is to create positive experiences, as these can effect the state of user in a positive way. This theory also questions whether it is in fact possible for us to design possible experiences, or if we as designers, can attempt to design experiences for specific contexts with no guarantee of a guaranteed intended experience.

                        </p> <p>
                     
                          These 3 all come together, with the ideal UX being a mixture of the 3.  Having a focus on experience, emotion, and user improvement, allows  for UXs that cater more to the user.  Hassenzahl and Tractinsky(2006) seem to maintain a firm position that the goal is improving quality of life and creating quality experiences , rather than simply ensuring the absence of problems.

                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Graham(2015 ) poses the argument that information is defined by its geography.  All information has a source, and this source(geography) defines the view of the data and influences the message or interpretation thereof(Graham 2015).  The data thus reflects the geography from which it originates. Given our current reach towards information from sources all over the world, information is changed, transformed, and reinterpreted as it is disseminated across a wide variety of geographies.  Graham refers to this as being the mobility and adaptability  of information. For information to thus be  kept  consistent and prevent change, there is thus the need for ‘immutable mobiles’, being forms of information reproduction  that limit the changeability of info, such as newspapers, given that they are print media and primarily not publicly usable.  This form also limits the transferal of information into another form(Graham 2015). These forms are important as they keep the information true to the geography that produced it by maintaining the sourced information. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Before the digital age, information was both limited in terms of researchable information, tools for that, and of accessibility. In terms of accessibility, there were large limitations related to the  reproduction and storage of physical information, such as books.  Graham (2015 )talks additional about how during this age, there was little room for reproduction into other mediums, thus meaning that paper based information was most likely to be published, and given the that few had the resources to reproduce this,  information was left largely unedited from the source, and production of information was largely under control of a few. This control over information production has a clear links to things such as propaganda used during wars, as publishing was restricted  to a few who held power. 
                               
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Onto the information revolution, leading to the digital age. This boom of computer accessibility, making use of internet to send and receive information across the globe, ushered in a new age. However this by no means implies that technology is accessible. Many places across the world lack access to internet, almost a prerequisite for   engagement and interaction in the digital space.   There is not only access inequalities, but also user skill inequalities that ultimately play a role in the lack of representation of thought available from certain geographies.  Large areas across the world still lack anything close to digital access, and this usually shows the  links the digital divide to societal inequalities . Technology is expensive, and places such as 3rd world countries cannot afford this on a broad scale, and even if it were possible, the skill inequality across the digital divide would still provide issues.     </p> <p>
                           
                                I think it is important to look at the digital divide in relation to societal divisions. I believe that should we reduce the gap in the digital divide, we create possibilities to reduce the gap society by providing more and more access to tools necessary to function in the digital age. 
                              <p>
                                
                                Lastly there’s the idea of geographies of representation, this refers to how information is specifically meant for certain groups, and how accessible and existent these types of content are. Graham (2015)draws on Google search results of Germany, however in different languages, and the resulting  response to illustrate how the same information from different geographies caters to different users and providing  remediations of information for catered geographies. 
                                
      
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                Ultimately it is important to study deeper into information geographies as this indicates the underlying effects of geographies on information, as well as the disparity between different geographical information, and this is data we can use to better provide fair access to across the globe.

                                Lutz(2019) goes into depth on the disparity between access to technology across the world. This lack of access is what defines the digital divide. The digital divide is  the gap between those that have the resources necessary to benefit from the digital and those which do not.  This refers to access to technological infrastructure as well as considering social inequalities that have an impact on this.  The digital divide closes links to social disparities, third world countries for example would not benefit much from the digital age to a lack of infrastructure.

                                I find this ultimately relates to information geography. Information geography refers to where information comes from and how this source effects the interpretation and purpose of information. Given that the digital divide links to societal inequalities, this means that we will ultimately receive less variations and interpretations, as well as new studies, from these places, meaning we are missing out on perspectives due to the digital divide.

                              <p>
                                The digital divide contains 3  levels, the first being internet access, the second being the difference between skill, following access to the internet, and how it is used. Finally , the 3rd level builds onto this, refereeing to the difference in gain from the previous two. This refers to how useful the information is to different groups across the divide.  
                              </p> <p>
                           
                                I think it is important to look at the digital divide in relation to societal divisions. I believe that should we reduce the gap in the digital divide, we create possibilities to reduce the gap society by providing more and more access to tools necessary to function in the digital age.

                                UX from my understanding, refers to a user’s reaction to interactions in a design object. This means that it is not the design itself that defines a successful  user experience, but the resulting response from the user. These experiences can and will vary with different users, but the goal is to create as catering and satisfying an experience as possible.

                              <p>
                               
                                When we consider UX we need to consider many variables. These include, the item itself, the user and their experience, and the context.  The item needs a clear design for the user to have a desirable experience,   and this is all affected by the context. Certain contexts will create certain expectation to the user, and the item has to be in line with this for good UX design, as fitting these to the expectations and presumptions of the user will create a better experience.

                              <p>
                                We must however still consider interactions across the design and how they work together in terms of experience. Normal and Nielsen(2011) talk about singular and accumulated experiences, essentially explaining that a single interaction can be viewed as a singular experience, however the sum of all these interactions  is the accumulated experiences.  It is this accumulated experience that has the larger effect on the user experience. In terms of a website, a single interaction may be satisfying , however combined with other lackluster components creates a bad user experience, as the accumulated experiences do not provide satisfying overall results to the user. 
                               </p> 
                               <p>
                                Given that we are essentially attempting to pull a reaction from the user, it is also important we look at the ethics of UX. We are essentially influencing , consciously or subconsciously,  the user. We must decide how we wish to deal with the user. Good intentions can often lead to UX that encourages user learning and understanding of how the site operates , allowing them to adapt to navigation for a better experience over time. There are even things to consider in regards to the purpose,  but the humanness of the user should also be considered. A good example would be a factory producing a product, the system may be designed for optimal efficiency but having solely a focus on this could result in a poor experience for workers.

                                  Looking at my own website, I can see where issues that reduce the user experience  are. The blogposts section for example is relatively hard to read, straining the reader and providing an undesirable experience, despite the smooth dropdown from clicking a blogpost. This could be an example where the accumulated  experience from the blogposts section is negative.
